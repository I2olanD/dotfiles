Encryption\n\t- ## Encryption in flight (TLS / SSL)\n\t  * Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving\n\t  * TLS certificates help with encryption (HTTPS)\n\t  * Encryption ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen\n\t- ## Encryption on Server-Side at rest\n\t  * Data is encrypted after being received by the server\n\t  * Data is decrypted before being sent\n\t  * It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)\n\t  * The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere and the server must have access to it ![HTTP(S).png](../assets/HTTP(S)_1710361335223_0.png)\n\t- ## Client-side encryption\n\t  * Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server\n\t  * Data will be decrypted by a receiving client\n\t  * The server should not be able to decrypt the data\n\t  * Could leverage Envelope Encryption ![Data key.png](../assets/Data_key_1710361351853_0.png)\n\t- ## Overview\n\t  * Anytime you hear “encryption” for an AWS service, it’s most likely KMS\n\t  * AWS manages encryption keys for us\n\t  * Fully integrated with IAM for auth\n\t  * Easy way to control access to your data\n\t  * Able to audit KMS Key usage using CloudTrail\n\t  * Seamlessly integrated into most AWS Services (EBS, S3, RDS, SSM,…)\n\t  * Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code\n\t      * KMS key encryption als available through API calls (SDK, CLI)\n\t      * Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables\n\t- ## KMS Keys Types\n\t  * KMS Keys is the new name of KMS Customer Master Key\n\t  * Symmetric (AES-256 keys)\n\t      * Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt\n\t      * AWS services that are integrated with KSM use Symmetric CMK (Customer Managed Keys)s\n\t      * You never get access to to the KMS unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)\n\t  * Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)\n\t      * Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair\n\t      * Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations\n\t      * The public key is downloadable, but you can’t access the Private Key unencrypted\n\t      * Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can’t call the KMS API\n\t- ## AWS KMS (Key Management Service)\n\t  * Types of KMS keys:\n\t      * AWS Owned Keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (default key)\n\t      * AWS Managed Key: (free) (aws/service-name, example: aws/rds or aws/ebs)\n\t      * Customer managed keys created in KMS: $1 / month\n\t      * Customer managed keys imported (must be symmetric key): $1 / month\n\t      * + pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 1000 calls)\n\t  * Automatic Key rotation:\n\t      * AWS-managed KMS Key: automatic every 1 year\n\t      * Customer-managed KMS Key (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year\n\t      * Imported KMS Key: only manual rotation possible using alias\n\t- ## Copying Snapshots across region\n\t\t- EBS Volumes are scope per region\n\t\t- Take a snapshot of the volume\n\t\t- Snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS Key\n\t\t- Copy the Snapshot to another region\n\t\t- Re-Encrypt with new KMS Key in the other region\n\t\t- Restore the Snapshot into its own EBS volume\n\t- ## KMS Key Policies\n\t  * Controll access to KMS keys, “similar” to S3 bucket policies\n\t  * Difference: you cannot control access
